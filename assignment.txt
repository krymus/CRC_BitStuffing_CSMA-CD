1. write a framing program according to the principle of "bitstuffing" (given in the lecture), 
and verifying the correctness of the frame using the CRC method . The program is to read a certain source file 
text file 'Z' containing any string composed of the characters '0' and '1' (simulating a bit stream)
and write the properly formatted string to another text file 'W'. 
The program should calculate and insert into the frame CRC check fields - formatted with
 strings composed of the characters '0' and '1'. Write a program that implements the reverse procedure, 
i.e. which reads the resultant file 'W' and for correct CRC data rewrites its content 
so as to obtain a copy of the original source file 'Z'.

2. Write a program (group of programs) to simulate the Ethernet method of accessing the transmission medium (CSMA/CD). 
The common link is implemented using an array: the propagation of the signal is simulated using the propagation of the 
values to neighboring cells. Realize the exercise so that the simulations can be easily tested 
and that the results obtained are easy to interpret.
